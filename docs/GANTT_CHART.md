## ⚠️ Risks & Concerns

1. **Time Risk:** Employer features are complex - might take longer than 2 weeks
   - **Solution:** Start early, ask for help if stuck

2. **Testing Risk:** Might find lots of bugs during testing phase
   - **Solution:** Test as we build, don't wait until the end

3. **Learning Curve:** Some features (file upload, email) are new to us
   - **Solution:** Research tutorials, try simple versions first

---

## 💡 Tips for Staying on Track

1. **Work in small chunks** - Don't try to do everything at once
2. **Test frequently** - Check your work often
3. **Ask for help** - Don't struggle alone for too long
4. **Take breaks** - Rest is important for good coding!
5. **Update this chart** - Keep the timeline current
